# C-Programming
A Place to hold work while reading The C Programming Language

## The C Programming Language 

    - This repository will hold, Excersises, Projects, and sample code both from the book and independently from myself.
    - As a C++ intermediate developer, I would like to understand the underlying C code that is part of the language. 
    - I don't intend for C to be my new go to, or primary language, but more of a fill in the gap of certain things, and possibly another option in certain situations. 
    - I do write firmware on MC and even thought I use Modern C++ to acheive what I need to, there are times I come across legacy code in libraries that I don't quite understand 
    - due to them being written in C. So my hope is that this will help with that.
